# Experimental Verification of Emergent Time: Final Results Repository

This repository hosts the **final numerical and statistical results** supporting the findings published in the research letter: **"Experimental Verification of Emergent Time: Mapping Relativistic Dilation to Energy Differentials."**

The files provided here include the detailed statistical summaries and data outputs (e.g., residual distributions) required to verify the core claims of the Timeless-Energy Axiom (TEA) against high-precision empirical data.
